0,0.0,10349422,"In one embodiment, a server of a first wireless communication network receives a wireless communication originated by a terminal of the first wireless communication network, the wireless communication containing a current geographic location of the terminal as determined by the terminal. The server may then determine acceptable communication parameters for the terminal to communicate on the first wireless communication network, e.g., based on preventing transmission by the terminal that might interfere with operation of one or more unintended receivers. The server then generates an instruction message for the terminal based on the acceptable communication parameters, and transmits the instruction message toward the terminal to cause the terminal to only continue transmitting according to acceptable communication parameters.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=3&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=drone&OS=drone&RS=drone,Server participation in avoidance of interference in wireless communications
1,0.954519787949486,10164938,"A method for managing a wireless communications system may include the steps of: (1) requesting wireless communication links between a plurality of user terminals and an airborne communications relay terminal, (2) designating one of the plurality of user terminals as a primary user terminal to make a direct communication with the relay terminal, (3) designating other ones of the plurality of user terminals as secondary user terminals to make direct communication with the primary user terminal, (4) connecting the primary user terminal directly to the relay terminal, and (5) connecting the secondary user terminals indirectly to the relay terminal through the primary user terminal.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=128&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=MANET&p=3&OS=MANET&RS=MANET,Wireless communications system and method for managing and optimizing a wireless communications network
2,1.0076086553469124,10337297,"A method (5) and a system 100 are provided for maintaining a self-service terminal (1). The maintenance is effected using a mobile terminal (3), such as a smartphone. A server application that can communicate first via a communication link (23) with a terminal application that is executed on the mobile terminal (3) and second via a network connection (21) with the self-service terminal (1) is executed on a server (2). Direct communication between the mobile terminal (3) and the self-service terminal (1) is not necessary. The mobile terminal (3) uses a still picture production apparatus (31) to capture both an identifier (11) for the self-service terminal (1) and an identifier (121) for a maintained component (12) of the self-service terminal (1), and transmits corresponding data to the server (2). On the basis of this, the server application can ascertain update data and communicate them to the self-service terminal (1).",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=620&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=RFID&p=13&OS=RFID&RS=RFID,Smartphone-assisted maintenance of a self-service terminal
3,1.0186725138924906,9507498,"An approach is provided for using one or more identification parameters of terminals associated with a communication session to initiate another communication session among the terminals. A communication platform determines one or more identification parameters associated with one or more terminals participating in at least one communication session. The communication platform further causes, at least in part, an initiation of at least one other communication session among the one or more terminals based, at least in part, on the one or more identification parameters.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=802&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=MANET&p=17&OS=MANET&RS=MANET,Method and apparatus for communication session-based initiation of networked terminals
4,1.0219579821077691,9430385,"Methods and apparatuses are provided for operating multi-type beacons by a first terminal connected with a second terminal through wireless communication. The first terminal receives, from the second terminal, information required for allocating a beacon type. The first terminal selects a beacon type for the second terminal from predetermined beacon types based on at least one variable in the information. The at least one variable includes at least one of a channel condition of a communication link between the first terminal and the second terminal, a traffic period of the communication link, and a security level of transmission and reception data. Each variable includes a priority. The first terminal allocates a beacon to the second terminal based on the priority of each variable. The beacon has the beacon type. The beacon allocated to the second terminal is transmitted from the first terminal to the second terminal.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=785&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=Piconet&p=16&OS=Piconet&RS=Piconet,Method for operating multi-type beacons
5,1.0320257694850339,10320480,"According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a method for processing a communication message. The method includes: acquiring a communication message transmitted between a first terminal and a second terminal; and sending prompt information to at least one of the first terminal and the second terminal when the communication message includes a predetermined schedule word, the predetermined schedule word being relevant to scheduling an appointment, the prompt information including information for reminding a user of the at least one of the first terminal and the second terminal to acquire contact information of a user of the other terminal.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=1268&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=RFID&p=26&OS=RFID&RS=RFID,Method and device for processing a communication message
