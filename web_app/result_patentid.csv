0,0.0,10349418,"Aspects of the subject disclosure may include, for example, a wireless communication node that receives instructions in a control channel directing it to utilize a spectral segment at a first carrier frequency to communicate with a mobile communication device. Responsive to the instructions, the wireless communication node receives a modulated signal in the spectral segment at a second carrier frequency from the base station, the modulated signal including communications data provided by the base station. The wireless communication node down-shifts the modulated signal at the second carrier frequency to the first carrier frequency, and wirelessly transmits the modulated signal at the first carrier frequency to the mobile communication device. Other embodiments are disclosed.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=4&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=drone&OS=drone&RS=drone,Method and apparatus for managing utilization of wireless resources via use of a reference signal to reduce distortion

3,0.8892365596484452,10354215,"Aspects of the subject disclosure may include, for example, receiving, by a network element of a distributed antenna system, a reference signal, an ultra-wideband control channel and a first modulated signal at a first carrier frequency, the first modulated signal including first communications data provided by a base station and directed to a mobile communication device. The instructions in the ultra-wideband control channel direct the network element of the distributed antenna system to convert the first modulated signal at the first carrier frequency to the first modulated signal in a first spectral segment. The reference signal is received at an in-band frequency relative to the control channel. Other embodiments are disclosed.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=9&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=Cache&OS=Cache&RS=Cache,Method and apparatus for use with a radio distributed antenna system having an ultra-wideband control channel
4,1.029893876569363,10349329,One or more embodiments provide a method implemented in a user equipment (UE) used in a wireless communications system. The method includes transmitting an indication to a base station that the UE is capable of transmitting on a single uplink carrier frequency and downlink carrier aggregation. The method also includes receiving an uplink carrier frequency switching pattern from the base station. The method also includes switching uplink carrier frequencies based on the uplink carrier frequency switching pattern.,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=12&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=Graphics&OS=Graphics&RS=Graphics,Methods of UL TDM for inter-eNodeB carrier aggregation
5,1.0597159937789142,9277498,"Some demonstrative embodiments include apparatuses, systems and/or methods of wireless backhaul communication between wireless communication nodes. For example, a wireless communication controller may control a wireless communication node to communicate with one or more other wireless communication nodes via one or more backhaul links of a backhaul network over a first frequency band, and to communicate with a control station via a control link over a second frequency band, the first frequency band is higher than the second frequency band.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=940&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=Piconet&p=19&OS=Piconet&RS=Piconet,"Apparatus, system and method of wireless backhaul communication between wireless communication nodes"
