0,0.8054777476803799,10300126,"The present invention relates to modified, live Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome viruses. Viruses were genetically analyzed and selected based on phylogenetic grouping for modification by repeated passage in tissue culture.

5,1.1322416428337068,10335478,Chimeric flaviviruses that are avirulent and immunogenic are provided. The chimeric viruses are constructed to contain amino acid mutations in the nonstructural viral proteins of a flavivirus. Chimeric viruses containing the attenuation-mutated nonstructural genes of the virus are used as a backbone into which the structural genes of a second flavivirus strain are inserted. These chimeric viruses elicit pronounced immunogenicity yet lack the accompanying clinical symptoms of viral disease. The attenuated chimeric viruses are effective as immunogens or vaccines and may be combined in a pharmaceutical composition to confer simultaneous immunity against several strains of pathogenic flaviviruses.,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=979&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=DNA&p=20&OS=DNA&RS=DNA,"Avirulent, immunogenic flavivirus chimeras"
