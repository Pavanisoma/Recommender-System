7852,10349236,"Optimizing aggregation routing over a network. In one example embodiment, a method for optimizing aggregation routing over a network may include detecting that aggregated account data is unavailable over a network from a first data aggregator server, detecting that the aggregated account data is available over the network from a second data aggregator server, formatting a request for the aggregated account data to be compatible with the second data aggregator server, routing the formatted request over the network to the second data aggregator server, and receiving the requested aggregated account data over the network from the second data aggregator server.",0.473709669,Optimizing aggregation routing over a network,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=285&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=Cache&p=6&OS=Cache&RS=Cache
1,10349418,"Aspects of the subject disclosure may include, for example, a wireless communication node that receives instructions in a control channel directing it to utilize a spectral segment at a first carrier frequency to communicate with a mobile communication device. Responsive to the instructions, the wireless communication node receives a modulated signal in the spectral segment at a second carrier frequency from the base station, the modulated signal including communications data provided by the base station. The wireless communication node down-shifts the modulated signal at the second carrier frequency to the first carrier frequency, and wirelessly transmits the modulated signal at the first carrier frequency to the mobile communication device. Other embodiments are disclosed.",0.393752644,Method and apparatus for managing utilization of wireless resources via use of a reference signal to reduce distortion,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=4&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=drone&OS=drone&RS=drone
9,10348514,"A lighting system includes lighting devices and an update manager. The lighting devices include various hardware versions and/or functionalities. The lighting devices are queried to determine existing hardware versions and/or functionalities. The query is sent via a wireless mesh network of the lighting system. An Over-The-Air (OTA) update includes multiple different lighting device programming images, where each image corresponds to one of the existing hardware versions and/or functionalities. The OTA update is delivered via point-to-point connections between the update manager and some number of lighting devices and/or between the lighting devices. Upon receipt, individual lighting devices determine whether a lighting device programming image is needed and/or which of the lighting device programming images is appropriate.",0.07998340799999999,Mesh over-the-air (OTA) driver update using site profile based multiple platform image,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=12&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=drone&OS=drone&RS=drone
7,10349197,"According to an aspect of an embodiment, an audio generation method includes: receiving an audio signal through at least one microphone; generating an input channel signal corresponding to each of the at least one microphone based on the received audio signal; generating a virtual input channel signal based on the input channel signal; generating additional information including reproduction locations of the input channel signal and the virtual input channel signal; and transmitting a multi-channel audio signal and the additional information, the multi-channel audio signal including the input channel signal and the virtual input channel signal.",0.07065658400000001,Method and device for generating and playing back audio signal,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=10&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=drone&OS=drone&RS=drone
