2326,9762954,"An approach for facilitating sharing of postal services is disclosed. In some implementations, a request to authorize access for a first account to one or more postal services of a second account may be received. The authorization request may include a first identifier associated with the first account and a second identifier associated with the second account. A message may be generated based on the first identifier, the second identifier, and/or other information. The generated message may be provided to a cryptographic platform. An integrity code associated with the first account and the second account may be received from the cryptographic platform in response to providing the generated message. The integrity code may be configured to enable the first account to access the one or more postal services of the second account.",0.40962725,System and method for secure sharing of postal services,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=496&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=MANET&p=10&OS=MANET&RS=MANET
1926,10188950,"An approach for facilitating access of postal services of an account by another account is disclosed. In some implementations, a request to authorize access for a first account to one or more postal services of a second account may be received. Responsive to authorization from the second account, the access to the one or more postal services of the second account may be enabled for the first account. A request initiated via the first account to execute a postal transaction associated with the one or more postal services of the second account may be received. Execution of the postal transaction may be initiated. Storage of a record related to the postal transaction in association with the second account may be initiated.",0.374663455,System and method for facilitating access of postal services of an account by another account,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=96&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=MANET&p=2&OS=MANET&RS=MANET
4533,10315622,The present disclosure relates to methods and devices for adjusting display brightness. A method may include determining original gray scale values of pixels of a display. The method may further include performing gray scale transformation on the original gray scale values of the pixels of the display to determine transformed gray scale values. The method may further include adjusting gray scale values of the pixels of the display to the transformed gray scale values.,0.346902056,Method and device for adjusting display brightness,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=1461&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=RFID&p=30&OS=RFID&RS=RFID
4069,10327239,"A system, apparatus, and method for processing payment transactions that are conducted using a mobile device that includes a contactless element, such as an integrated circuit chip. An account holder is enabled to generate transaction related data and append that data to a transaction record or transaction identifier. The appended data and transaction record or identifier may be stored in the mobile payment device and/or provided to an Issuer. If provided to an Issuer, the transaction related data generated by the account holder may be used to supplement an account statement. The additional information generated by the account holder may be used to assist the account holder in determining if a transaction is valid by providing information that helps the account holder to recall the location or other aspect of the transaction.",0.288394019,Recordation of electronic payment transaction information,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=995&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=RFID&p=20&OS=RFID&RS=RFID
2540,9584960,"An approach is provided for coordinating service information (e.g., account registration identifiers) across multiple server nodes. A server receives a request to register an identifier for an account. The server determines whether it is a home site for the identifier and processes the request based, at least in part, on the determination.",0.281888803,Method and apparatus for coordinating service information across multiple server nodes,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=710&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=MANET&p=15&OS=MANET&RS=MANET
