1958,10164938,"A method for managing a wireless communications system may include the steps of: (1) requesting wireless communication links between a plurality of user terminals and an airborne communications relay terminal, (2) designating one of the plurality of user terminals as a primary user terminal to make a direct communication with the relay terminal, (3) designating other ones of the plurality of user terminals as secondary user terminals to make direct communication with the primary user terminal, (4) connecting the primary user terminal directly to the relay terminal, and (5) connecting the secondary user terminals indirectly to the relay terminal through the primary user terminal.",0.534656841,Wireless communications system and method for managing and optimizing a wireless communications network,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=128&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=MANET&p=3&OS=MANET&RS=MANET
3694,10337297,"A method (5) and a system 100 are provided for maintaining a self-service terminal (1). The maintenance is effected using a mobile terminal (3), such as a smartphone. A server application that can communicate first via a communication link (23) with a terminal application that is executed on the mobile terminal (3) and second via a network connection (21) with the self-service terminal (1) is executed on a server (2). Direct communication between the mobile terminal (3) and the self-service terminal (1) is not necessary. The mobile terminal (3) uses a still picture production apparatus (31) to capture both an identifier (11) for the self-service terminal (1) and an identifier (121) for a maintained component (12) of the self-service terminal (1), and transmits corresponding data to the server (2). On the basis of this, the server application can ascertain update data and communicate them to the self-service terminal (1).",0.483796726,Smartphone-assisted maintenance of a self-service terminal,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=620&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=RFID&p=13&OS=RFID&RS=RFID
1617,9430385,"Methods and apparatuses are provided for operating multi-type beacons by a first terminal connected with a second terminal through wireless communication. The first terminal receives, from the second terminal, information required for allocating a beacon type. The first terminal selects a beacon type for the second terminal from predetermined beacon types based on at least one variable in the information. The at least one variable includes at least one of a channel condition of a communication link between the first terminal and the second terminal, a traffic period of the communication link, and a security level of transmission and reception data. Each variable includes a priority. The first terminal allocates a beacon to the second terminal based on the priority of each variable. The beacon has the beacon type. The beacon allocated to the second terminal is transmitted from the first terminal to the second terminal.",0.47786133700000005,Method for operating multi-type beacons,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=785&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=Piconet&p=16&OS=Piconet&RS=Piconet
444,10349329,One or more embodiments provide a method implemented in a user equipment (UE) used in a wireless communications system. The method includes transmitting an indication to a base station that the UE is capable of transmitting on a single uplink carrier frequency and downlink carrier aggregation. The method also includes receiving an uplink carrier frequency switching pattern from the base station. The method also includes switching uplink carrier frequencies based on the uplink carrier frequency switching pattern.,0.471816324,Methods of UL TDM for inter-eNodeB carrier aggregation,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=12&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=Graphics&OS=Graphics&RS=Graphics
2632,9507498,"An approach is provided for using one or more identification parameters of terminals associated with a communication session to initiate another communication session among the terminals. A communication platform determines one or more identification parameters associated with one or more terminals participating in at least one communication session. The communication platform further causes, at least in part, an initiation of at least one other communication session among the one or more terminals based, at least in part, on the one or more identification parameters.",0.461796485,Method and apparatus for communication session-based initiation of networked terminals,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=802&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=MANET&p=17&OS=MANET&RS=MANET
