7852,10349236,"Optimizing aggregation routing over a network. In one example embodiment, a method for optimizing aggregation routing over a network may include detecting that aggregated account data is unavailable over a network from a first data aggregator server, detecting that the aggregated account data is available over the network from a second data aggregator server, formatting a request for the aggregated account data to be compatible with the second data aggregator server, routing the formatted request over the network to the second data aggregator server, and receiving the requested aggregated account data over the network from the second data aggregator server.",0.473709669,Optimizing aggregation routing over a network,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=285&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=Cache&p=6&OS=Cache&RS=Cache
1,10349418,"Aspects of the subject disclosure may include, for example, a wireless communication node that receives instructions in a control channel directing it to utilize a spectral segment at a first carrier frequency to communicate with a mobile communication device. Responsive to the instructions, the wireless communication node receives a modulated signal in the spectral segment at a second carrier frequency from the base station, the modulated signal including communications data provided by the base station. The wireless communication node down-shifts the modulated signal at the second carrier frequency to the first carrier frequency, and wirelessly transmits the modulated signal at the first carrier frequency to the mobile communication device. Other embodiments are disclosed.",0.072669699,Method and apparatus for managing utilization of wireless resources via use of a reference signal to reduce distortion,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=4&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=drone&OS=drone&RS=drone
8,10348985,"A turbulence-free CCD camera system with nonclassical imaging resolution, for applications in long-distance imaging, such as satellite and aircraft-to-ground based distant imaging, utilizing an intensity-fluctuation correlation measurement of thermal light. The proposed camera system has the following advantages over classic imaging technology: (1) it is turbulence-free; (2) its spatial resolution is mainly determined by the angular diameter of the light source. For example, using sun as the light source, this camera may achieve a spatial resolution of 200 micrometer for any object on Earth. 200-micrometer resolution is insignificant for short distance imaging, however, taking a picture of a target at 10-kilometer, a classic camera must have a lens of 90-meter diameter in order to achieve 200-micrometer resolution. Unlike a classic camera, the proposed turbulence-free CCD camera system has adequate spatial resolution zoom a long distance and still distinguish the objects within a small area, even with a small lens.",0.065417685,Turbulence-free camera system and related method of image enhancement,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=11&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=drone&OS=drone&RS=drone
