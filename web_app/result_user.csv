1138,9930240,"A lighting device having an AC/DC or DC/DC power converter, a controller/processor electrically connected to the power converter, a LED current control circuit communicably coupled to the controller/processor and electrically connected to the power converter, and two or more LEDs communicably coupled to the LED current control circuit. The controller/processor determines a first and second number of counts for the LEDs to be ON to produce a blended light having a specified color, and generates control signal(s) based on the first and second number of counts. The LED current control circuit generates a first and second on/off signals having an on/off cycle time and first and second ON times corresponding to the first and second number of counts for the LEDs in response to the one or more control signals. The LEDs produce the blended light having the specified color in response to the first and second on/off signals.",0.581043438,LED lighting device,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=306&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=Piconet&p=7&OS=Piconet&RS=Piconet
3139,10354301,"Energy storage devices, servers, and methods for controlling the same are disclosed. The energy storage device can include at least one battery pack, a network interface configured to exchange data with a server, and a connector that receives alternating current (AC) power from an internal power network or outputs AC power to the internal power network. Energy storage device can also include a power converter configured to convert the AC power from the internal power network into direct current (DC) power based on the information about the power to store when information about power to store is received from the server, or, convert DC power stored in the battery pack into AC power based on the information about the power to output when information about power to output to the internal power network is received from the server. Accordingly, energy may be more efficiently stored.",0.380641244,"Energy storage device, and server and method for controlling the same",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=63&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=RFID&p=2&OS=RFID&RS=RFID
1601,9445219,A method and system for sharing a single antenna on platforms with collocated Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11 b/g devices are provided. A single antenna may be utilized for communication of Bluetooth HV3 frame traffic and wireless local area network (WLAN) communication based on a time multiplexing approach. At least one antenna switch may be utilized to configure an antenna system to enable Bluetooth and WLAN coexistence via the single antenna. Configuration signals may be generated by a Bluetooth radio device and/or by a WLAN radio device to configure the antenna system. A default configuration for the antenna system may provide WLAN communication between a station and a WLAN access point until Bluetooth communication becomes a priority.,0.349590808,Method and system for sharing a single antenna on platforms with collocated Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11 b/g devices,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=769&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=Piconet&p=16&OS=Piconet&RS=Piconet
