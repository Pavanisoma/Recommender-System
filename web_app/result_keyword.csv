0,0.7764653339898837,10301620,"A cloud manager, for forming neighborhood groups from disperse cloud providers, receives provider data relating to a plurality of disperse cloud providers for a plurality of data subcategories classified under N-number main categories. The cloud manager generates a respective vector to represent each of the plurality of disperse cloud providers based on the provider data. The cloud manager generates an N-number axis space comprising the vectors. The cloud manager groups the plurality of disperse cloud providers in the N-number axis space into at least one cloud provider group, based on the vectors and a clustering algorithm.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=1955&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=Cache&p=40&OS=Cache&RS=Cache,Forming neighborhood groups from disperse cloud providers

2,0.8932176987362541,10301625,"According to one embodiment, a request is received for estimating migrating a first dataset from a first cloud system to a second cloud system. A migration cost estimation module determines a network bandwidth required to migrate the first dataset from the first cloud system to the second cloud system, determines a duplicated data time period during migration that the first dataset has to be maintained by both the first cloud system and the second cloud system for service continuity, and determines a total cost of migrating the first dataset from the first cloud system to the second cloud system based on the required network bandwidth and the duplicated data time period. It is then determined whether to migrate the first dataset from the first cloud system to the second cloud system based on the total cost.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=1952&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=Cache&p=40&OS=Cache&RS=Cache,Multi-cloud data migration in platform as a service (PAAS) environment
3,0.9396518598134329,10361931,"Cloud protection techniques are provided. A security breach is detected in a source cloud environment. An enterprise system processing in the source cloud environment is immediately locked down and is dynamically migrated to a target cloud environment. While the enterprise system is migrating, the source cloud environment creates a fake environment with fake resources within the source cloud environment to dupe an intruder having access as a result of the security breach. Metrics and logs are gathered with respect to activities of the intruder within the source cloud environment.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=490&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=Virus&p=10&OS=Virus&RS=Virus,Cloud protection techniques
4,0.9712614882691377,9549364,An approach is provided for determining a cloud provider identifier associated with a request to provision one or more communication services. The approach further involves validating the request by matching the cloud provider identifier against another copy of the cloud provider identifier associated with a session over which the provisioning request was received.,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=753&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=MANET&p=16&OS=MANET&RS=MANET,Method and apparatus for dynamic provisioning of communication services
5,0.9802596964553653,10301632,"A cloud agent facilitates collection of industrial data from one or more data sources on the plant floor and migration of the collected data to a cloud platform for storage and processing. Collection services associated with the cloud agent perform on-premise data collection of historical, live, and/or alarm data directly from industrial devices networked to the agent or from intermediate data concentrators that gather the data from the devices. Queue processing services executed by the cloud agent package the data into a data packet comprising header information that identifies a customer associated with the industrial enterprise, processing priority information, and other information that informs data processing services on the cloud platform how to process and/or direct the incoming data. The cloud agent then establishes a communication channel to the cloud platform and sends the data via the channel.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=1948&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=Cache&p=39&OS=Cache&RS=Cache,On-premise data collection and ingestion using industrial cloud agents
