0,0.7746429898036176,10341873,"A cloud manager, for forming neighborhood groups from disperse cloud providers, receives provider data relating to a plurality of disperse cloud providers for a plurality of data subcategories classified under N-number main categories. The cloud manager generates a respective vector to represent each of the plurality of disperse cloud providers based on the provider data. The cloud manager generates an N-number axis space comprising the vectors. The cloud manager groups the plurality of disperse cloud providers in the N-number axis space into at least one cloud provider group, based on the vectors and a clustering algorithm.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=706&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=Cache&p=15&OS=Cache&RS=Cache,Command parameter resolution for command invocations
1,0.7890562856727197,10341360,"Provided is a cloud control server that controls a plurality of cloud servers, the cloud control server including a communication unit configured to transmit, to a mobile device, information about one or more cloud servers from among the plurality of cloud servers, and to receive, from the mobile device, identification information of a cloud server that is selected by a user of the mobile device and is from among the one or more cloud servers; and a controller configured to migrate a virtual machine of the mobile device to the selected cloud server from a cloud server in which the virtual machine of the mobile device is located and that is from among the plurality of cloud servers, wherein the virtual machine of the mobile device executes an application that is output from the mobile device.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=1364&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=Cache&p=28&OS=Cache&RS=Cache,Forwarding policies on a virtual service network
2,0.8919241250574944,10341921,"According to one embodiment, a request is received for estimating migrating a first dataset from a first cloud system to a second cloud system. A migration cost estimation module determines a network bandwidth required to migrate the first dataset from the first cloud system to the second cloud system, determines a duplicated data time period during migration that the first dataset has to be maintained by both the first cloud system and the second cloud system for service continuity, and determines a total cost of migrating the first dataset from the first cloud system to the second cloud system based on the required network bandwidth and the duplicated data time period. It is then determined whether to migrate the first dataset from the first cloud system to the second cloud system based on the total cost.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=703&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=Cache&p=15&OS=Cache&RS=Cache,Short-range device interactions for facilitating partial uses of clustered access rights
3,0.9355531068087787,10340275,"Cloud protection techniques are provided. A security breach is detected in a source cloud environment. An enterprise system processing in the source cloud environment is immediately locked down and is dynamically migrated to a target cloud environment. While the enterprise system is migrating, the source cloud environment creates a fake environment with fake resources within the source cloud environment to dupe an intruder having access as a result of the security breach. Metrics and logs are gathered with respect to activities of the intruder within the source cloud environment.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=853&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=Cache&p=18&OS=Cache&RS=Cache,"Display device, and integrated remote controller setting method and system for same"
4,0.9689933893891214,9807080,An approach is provided for determining a cloud provider identifier associated with a request to provision one or more communication services. The approach further involves validating the request by matching the cloud provider identifier against another copy of the cloud provider identifier associated with a session over which the provisioning request was received.,http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=448&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=MANET&p=9&OS=MANET&RS=MANET,Method and apparatus for providing safety services relating to mobile devices
