3,1.0267860556983077,10359925,"The invention aims to backtrack a virus infection route with more detail than in the conventional case. CPUs of client devices respectively monitor operations, and cause storage devices to store operation histories. The CPU determines, upon detecting a virus, the time and date at which the virus was first saved in the client device based on the operation history stored in the storage device, and determines a virus intrusion route based on the operation content that was executed at the determined time and date.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=993&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=Virus&p=20&OS=Virus&RS=Virus,"Virus intrusion route identification device, virus intrusion route identification method, and program"
4,1.0996711881142724,10313304,"A compound having an antiviral activity for inhibiting release of an enveloped virus from a cell is disclosed, including methods of inhibiting release of an enveloped virus from a cell. The antiviral activity of the compound includes inhibiting formation of an associative complex or disrupting formation of an associative complex. The associative complex comprises an L-domain motif of the enveloped virus and at least one cellular polypeptide, or fragment thereof, capable of binding the L-domain motif of the enveloped virus.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=1884&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=Virus&p=38&OS=Virus&RS=Virus,Methods and compounds to inhibit enveloped virus release
