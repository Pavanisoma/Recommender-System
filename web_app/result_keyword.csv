0,0.9999999999999992,10335791,"The present invention relates to a method for identifying multi-modal associations between biomedical markers which allows for the determination of network nodes and/or high ranking network members or combinations thereof, indicative of having a diagnostic, prognostic or predictive value for a medical condition, in particular ovarian cancer. The present invention further relates to a biomedical marker or group of biomedical markers associated with a high likelihood of responsiveness of a subject to a cancer therapy, preferably a platinum based cancer therapy, wherein said biomedical marker or group of biomedical markers comprises at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 8, 19, 20 or all markers selected from PKMYT1, SKIL, RAB8A, HIRIP3, CTNNB1, NGFR, ZCCHC11, LSP1, CD200, PAX8, CYBRD1, HOXC11, TCEAL1, FZD10, FZD1, BBS4, IRS2, TLX3, TSPAN2, TXN, and CFLAR. Furthermore, an assay for detecting, diagnosing, graduating, monitoring or prognosticating a medical condition, or for detecting, 1 diagnosing, monitoring or prognosticating the responsiveness of a subject to a therapy against said medical condition, in particular ovarian cancer, is provided, as well as a corresponding method for classifying a subject comprising and a medical decision support system.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=727&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=DNA&p=15&OS=DNA&RS=DNA,Identification of multi-modal associations between biomedical markers

2,0.9999999999999994,10360600,"Systems, methods, and computer-readable storage media for hardware recovery are disclosed. In some examples, a system can detect a hardware error and identify a system component associated with the hardware error. The system can then generate a request configured to trigger an operating system of the system to place the system in a particular operating state. The particular operating state can be determined based on a component type of the system component. The particular operating state can be a first sleep state when the component type is a peripheral component or a second sleep state when the component type is a processor, a memory, or a power supply. The second sleep state can result in a lower power resource consumption than the first sleep state. The system can generate an indication that the system component can be replaced without restarting the operating system.",http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=755&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&s1=Sensor&p=16&OS=Sensor&RS=Sensor,Hardware recovery systems
